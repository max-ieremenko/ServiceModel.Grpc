-----------
A fast and more user-friendly MessagePack serialization library for .NET and .NET Framework. This package is brought to you by one of the two major contributors to MessagePack-CSharp. As its natural successor, this library comes packed with features that its predecessor lacks, and has ongoing support.

Premium support for trimming and Native AOT, secure deserialization of untrusted data, async serialization, streaming deserialization, skip serializing of default values, reference preservation, and support for reference cycles.

Also features an automatic structural equality API.
